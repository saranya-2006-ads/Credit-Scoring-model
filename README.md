CREDIT SCORING MODEL
This project aims to build a Credit Scoring Model using Logistic Regression to predict whether an individual is likely to default on a loan based on their financial and demographic attributes. The dataset includes variables such as income, savings, debt ratios, and categorical indicators like credit card ownership and mortgage status.
Predict binary loan default (DEFAULT: 1 = default, 0 = no default).
Use logistic regression as the primary classification algorithm.
Evaluate the model using performance metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix.
steps in process:
1.Preprocess the dataset: drop irrelevant columns, handle missing values, encode categorical variables.
2.Scale numeric features for better model performance.
3.Train/test split and model training using LogisticRegression.
4.Visualize performance using a ROC Curve.
